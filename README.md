# Flutter app architecture

## Introduction

This sample demonstrates how one can

- Setup base architecture of Flutter app using Stacked plugin
- Use dependency injection for layers separation
- Code generator to generate boilerplate code for DI, routes and JSON parsing
- Make api calls using Retrofit plugin (mostly Android developers might be familier with it).

Apart from the basic architecture setup, this sample also demonstrates

- Project folder structure
- Navigation using ViewModel (without context)
- Easy data sharing between the screens
- And few more...

## Setup

One can download the code in zip format or take checkout from the git repository.

### Note
You need to run build_runner command for code generation everytime when you make changes in your original file.
